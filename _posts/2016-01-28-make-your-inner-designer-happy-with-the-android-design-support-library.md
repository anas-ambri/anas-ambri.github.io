A new year, a new presentation. Today, I will be presenting Google's new Android Material design support library at the Android Montreal meetup. Leaving the slides for the presentation here for future reference. Also, this time, there is a cool [github repo](https://github.com/anas-ambri/DesignSupportLibraryDemo/commits) with instructions and stuff.
