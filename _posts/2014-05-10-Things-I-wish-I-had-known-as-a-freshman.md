##TL;DR
If you are in University in a technical field, make sure to:

- not put your major up a piedestal
- talk to as many people as possible
- hang out with people who challenge you
- take at least one English writing class
- play the GPA card wisely

For the past five years, I have been doing this thing called going to university. Because it has been a life-changing experience, the least I could do was to reflect on it, and try to enumerate all the things first-year me was better off knowing.

Know, however, that these points spring from my personal experience, and might be specific to Montreal and/or Concordia University. As with any advice on the Internet, your mileage will vary.

##You're paying good money for this!
If you are doing any kind of post-secondary education in North America, you are  paying for it. While the situation in Canada is not as ridiculous as in the US, it is still very good money, that you chose to spend bettering yourself through higher education. *Make sure to take advantage of everything your school has to offer*.

Believe me, you would be surprised of what is happening around you; especially if you live in a city with such an active student life as Montreal. 

##You are not a unique snowflake, not in a city with 100,000 other students
Students, especially in super-technical fields, tend to put their major up a piedestal. I have been victim of this myself, and it is quite a normal thing to do, given the environment we develop in. Yes, engineers are some very special people, capable of turning vaguely-worded requirements into working solutions. It turns out that most people you will meet in a bar (no, not your 1$-a-beer school bar, an actual "grown-ups" bar) are not engineers, and have absolutely no idea
