Today, I will be giving a talk on MVP (Model-View-Presenter) on Android. While preparing the presentation, I came with a bunch of memes that describe, in my humble opinion, the state of UI testing in Android.

Since I won't be using them all (there are 39 of them), I thought I could just share them here. Please use them wisely.
