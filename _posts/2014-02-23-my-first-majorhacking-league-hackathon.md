This past weekend, I participated in McHacks, a Major Hacking League hackathon hosted at McGill University, in Montreal. The organizers were advertising the event as the largest hackathon that Canada has ever seen, so I definitely was not going to miss it.

Our hackathon idea was to develop a tool to simplify the process of doing technical phone interviews.
