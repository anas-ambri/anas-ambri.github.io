This past Thursday, I gave my first developer talk at the Android Montreal User Group. It revolved around using Groovy on Android, and the experience was extremely fun. I am leaving here a link to the slides I used for future reference.

Now that I think about it, maybe I should make a more detailed post on how to use Groovy on Android.
