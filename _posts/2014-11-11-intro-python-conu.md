Today, I will giving an introductory workshop on Python at Concordia University. This is not the first time I do a tutorial, but it certainly feels exciting to go back to my school looking all smart and knowledgeable. For the tutorial, I will be using the following slides plus a [ipython notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/anas-ambri/intro-python-ConU/blob/master/Intro_Python.ipynb) hosted on [github](https://github.com/anas-ambri/intro-python-ConU). IPython is the best thing that happened to learning programming since the Apple ][.
