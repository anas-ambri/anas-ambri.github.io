This is a shy attempt at writing something controversial; after all, I won't be making front page of HackerNews talking about functional programming.

What if the greatest programmers were also philosophers? Who would they be? What would be their philosophies?

Disclaimer: I have never formally studied philosophy, nor (obviously) do I personally know any of these people.
Steve Yegge created a political axis, I'm making a philosophical one.

Steve Yegge: the Voltaire of modern programming

Joel Spolsky

P Graham: utilitarian in his treatment of philosophy. Mention his opinion on the distribution of wealth.

Peter Norvig: Pascal

Alan Kay

Jeff Atwood: Use his definition of programming from the '<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/06/finally-a-definition-of-programming-i-can-actually-understand.html">Definition of programming I can actually understand.</a>"

JWZ: Hobbes
