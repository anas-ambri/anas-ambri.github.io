If you have ever read any of Steve Yegge's articles, you could easily feel that he is a smart fellow, who uses mind-bending metaphors and crucifying aphorisms to get his point across. Any geek definitely enjoys reading him, and his articles are examples of genius and humor. He is the fellow behind Java's kingdom of nouns, but also behind the discovery of the first Haskell industry programmer who gives a shit, and was the first to report Wikileaks' attack against private Java classes.

Not saying that Steve was horrible, but he got really better, really really really better.

A blogger becomes famous because he manages to create a community around his blog. Steve Yegge started with Amazoners, then expanded into the community of dynamic language programmers.

Paul Graham targets with his posts startup-oriented people, Joel Spolsky is more interested into councelling people who work with programmers than programmers themselves (probably an East Coast thing). Even Chris Coyier targetted a specific subset of Web designers.
