Recently, I was developed a very serious disease. Nothing too serious, but, among its symptoms, was a very high intolerance to horrible design, eye bleeding when interacting with non-functional systems, and a raise in heart beat when witnessing the crumbling of a system.

After checking up with a series of doctors, it turned out that this disease was simply an allergy to broken things, more commonly known under the name 'this-is-broken-isis'. First discovered by the marketing genius Seth Godin, its symptoms can range from the need to scratch every inch^2 of your itchy skin, to the need to 'transpercer one's eyes'.
I noticed it when I started filling in my tax receipt using the BMO software, then I saw this.

Why is this broken? Well, simply because the two reviews are saying the same thing. They are not 'the most favorable' and 'most critical', they just happen to give a different number of stars.And, knowing what star-based rating systems are really worth, you got to wonder if the people who implemented this were, after all, just lazy.

This is why, from now on, I am taking on the task to fix whatever things I find broken. Yep, I just said it. This will be my way to reduce the entropy in this world. You can already call me batman if you want.

So, here it is a solution on how to fix the Amazon problem.
