Did you ever wonder what happens between the moment you click on an app's icon, and the moment the app is displayed? Wonder no longer. 

This presentation was first made public at the [GDG Android Montreal group](https://developers.google.com/events/5435287602462720/).

I agree that this content would be better presented in a series of blog posts, but, you know, ain't nobody got time fo' that.
