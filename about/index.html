  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>
    My name is Anas Ambri, and I am an <b>aspiring software developer</b> ('humble software developer' was already taken, so I went for the next coolest title).</p>
  <p>
    I am a final year Computer Engineering student at <a href="http://concordia.com">Concordia University</a>, and expected to graduate in May 2014. When I am not writing software to solve problems at <a href="http://www.radialpoint.com">Radialpoint</a>, you can usually find me working on some <a href="http://apearaday.tumblr.com/">personal</a> <a href="https://github.com/anas-ambri">projects</a>, mumbling some words on this very same website, or learning new things. My ultimate goal is to own a pet tiger.

    PS: I know I am not supposed to tell you what to do, but, you know, you could always <a href="https://twitter.com/AnasAmbri">follow me on Twitter</a>
