## Thor Jekyll
The script `jekyll.thor` was developed by [Jonas Forsberg](http://jonasforsberg.se/2012/12/28/create-jekyll-posts-from-the-command-line), and can be used as follows:

    thor jekyll:new Title of post

This will create an unpublished post under _posts/ with filename:
    
    2014-02-20-title-of-post.md

Assuming today's date is 2014/02/20
